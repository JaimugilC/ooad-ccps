## Description

A simple Credit Card processing system with three main actors *Customer*, *Banker* and *Merchant*.
A new Customer can apply for a credit card to the bank by submitting necessary details.
The Banker validates the user and accepts or rejects the request based on the result.
After getting a credit card, the user can buy products with it. And those Credits will be sent to the merchant and stored as batches. Now the Merchant can send those batches to the bank to transfer them into acutal funds.
